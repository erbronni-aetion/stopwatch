# Stopwatch

Build a stopwatch with the following features:

- Display time in the following format: `00:00:00` (min:sec:ms)  
- 3 actions: Start/Stop, Split and Reset
- Start: starts the stopwatch. Button changes to Stop when stopwatch is running.
- Stop: stops the stopwatch. Button changes to Start when stopwatch is stopped.
- Split: takes a snapshot of the stopwatch and displays under the buttons.
- Reset: resets to initial state (00:00:00 and clears the split times).

Write a test to validate the time display logic
